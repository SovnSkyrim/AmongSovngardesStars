There are many ways that you can contribute to this modlist. Pick one of the parts below that you want to contribute to:

- [Contributing](#contributing)
  - [Modlist](#modlist)
    - [Feature Requests](#feature-requests)
    - [Issues](#issues)
    - [CharGen Presets](#chargen-presets)

## Modlist

Contributing to the Modlist itself is straight forward. You can have a [Feature Request](#feature-requests), report [Issues](#issues) or maybe you created an awesome character that you want to share.

### Feature Requests

Head over to the GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/ixanza/xanzas_lotd/issues) page and check if your request was already made by someone else. If you found no similar posts, create a new request by clicking the green `New issues` button in the top right corner. Select `Feature request` and fill out the document.

### Issues

Similar to [Feature Requests](#feature-requests), go to the GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/ixanza/xanzas_lotd/issues) page and check if your issue was already reported. If you found no similar posts, create a new issue by clicking the green `New issues` button in the top right corner. Select `Bug report` and fill out the document.

### CharGen Presets

You can share your created Character Preset and I can include it in the Modlist if you want. Head over to [this](https://github.com/ixanza/xanzas_lotd/issues) page and click `Add CharGen Preset`.

For your preset to be added to the Modlist there are certain requirements it has to meet:

- No additional character mods got used
- You used the latest version of the Modlist
- You exported **both** the preset **and** the head from the sculpt menu
- The file name match this syntax: `[Race](f/m) - Name`

Example file names:

- `[Nord](f) - Alice`
- `[Darkelf](m) - Bob`
