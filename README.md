# Preamble

Based on Lexy's LOTD, this list changes/adds a lot of areas the base doesn't touch. Focusing on expanding the mechanics, worldspace and roleplaying, we use needs mods including Frostfall/RND/Campfire/Keep It Clean, as well as the full EnaiRim suite and many land mods including VIGILANT and Undeath. Many animations have been changed, player homes and followers added, hunting and religion are core to gameplay. Weather options include Obsidian, Cathedral and Vivid Weathers. Join the discord or check the GitHub post for more information.

Check the [Changelog](https://github.com/SovnSkyrim/AmongSovngardesStars/blob/master/Changelog.md) to see all the changes!

**Under no circumstances should you be bothering her or her team with issues for this list.**
Instead come in the discord I made for everything around the list! https://discord.gg/ZgjVrXp

## Installation
### Pre-Installation

These steps are only needed if you install this Modlist for the first time. If you update the Modlist, jump straight to [Updating](#updating).

#### Installing Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

I doubt you need to do this since you likely already have this installed. The package is required for MO2 and you can download it from [Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads). Download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019". [Direct link](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) if you can't find it.

#### Steam Config

##### Disable the Steam Overlay

The Steam Overlay can cause issues with ENB and is recommended to be turned off.

Open the Properties window (right click the game in your Library->Properties), navigate to the _General_ tab and un-tick the _Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game_ checkbox.

#### Steam Library

If you have your steam library in program files, read [this](https://github.com/LostDragonist/steam-library-setup-tool/wiki/Usage-Guide) to put it somewhere else.
I will not provide support to people with Skyrim in their Program Files folder.

#### Change Steams Update Behavior

SSE is still being updated by Bethesda (they only add Creation Club content). Whenever the game updates, the entire modding community goes silent for the next one or two weeks because some mods need to be updated to the latest game runtime version.

To ensure that Steam does not automatically updates the game for you, head over to the Properties window, navigate to the _Updates_ tab and change _Automatic updates_ to _Only update this game when I launch it_. You should also disable the Steam Cloud while you're at it.

#### Set the Game language to English

Just do it. This entire Modlist is in English and 99% of all mods you will find are also in English. I highly recommend playing the game in English and **I will not give support to people with a non-English game**.

Open the Steam Properties window, navigate to the _Language_ tab and select _English_ from the dropdown menu.

#### Clean Skyrim

I highly recommend uninstalling the game through Steam, deleting the game folder and reinstalling it. You should also clean up the `Skyrim Special Edition` folder in `Documents/My Games/` by deleting the contents in it. Alternatively, use the Shredder: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30133

#### Start Skyrim

After you have done everything above and got a clean SSE installation ready, start the Launcher and open the _Options_ menu.

1. Click on _High_
2. Set the _Aspect Ratio_ and _Resolution_ to your monitor's native values
3. Set _Antialiasing_ to _Off_
4. Check _Windowed Mode_ and _Borderless_

Start the game and exit once you're in the main menu.

### Using Wabbajack

#### Preparations

Let's get to the actual installation. Grab the release of Among Sovngarde's Stars from available through the Discord server in #links.

Download the release to a _working folder_. This folder **must not** be in a _common folders_ like your Desktop, Downloads or Program Files folder. It's best to create a Wabbajack folder near the root level of your drive like `C:/Wabbajack`.

Grab the latest release of Wabbajack from [here](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases) and place the `Wabbajack.exe` file in the _working folder_.

#### Downloading and Installing

The download and installation process can take a very long time depending on your system specs. Wabbajack will calculate the amount of threads it will use at the start of the installation. To have the highest amount of threads and thus the fastest speed, it is advised to have the working folder on an SSD.

1. Open Wabbajack
2. Load _Among Sovngarde's Stars.wabbajack file_ from Disk
3. Create a folder for the List at the root of your drive (like the Wabbajack folder) called "Among Sovngarde's Stars".
4. Select the created folder in 3. as your installation folder.
5. Go back to your drive, and create a new folder, called "Wabbajack Downloads Folder". This specific folder can be on a different drive if you wish.
6. Select the created folder in 5. as your downloads folder.
7. Click the Go/Begin button.
8. Wait for Wabbajack to finish.

##### Problems with Wabbajack

There are a lot of different scenarios where Wabbajack will produce an error. I recommend re-running Wabbajack before posting anything. Wabbajack will continue where it left off so you loose no progress.

**Could not download x**:

If a mod updated and the old files got deleted, it is impossible to download them. In this case just wait till I update the Modlist.

**x is not a whitelisted download**:

This can happen when I update the modlist. Check if a new update is available and wait if there is none.

**Wabbajack could not find my game folder**:

Wabbajack will not work with a pirated version of the game. If you own the game on Steam, go back to the [Pre-Installation](#pre-installation) step.

### Post-Installation

#### Copy Game Folder Files

Download the latest ENB Series from [here](http://enbdev.com/download_mod_tesskyrimse.htm) and copy `d3d11.dll` and `d3dcompiler_46e.dll` to your game folder.

Copy the all of the files from the `MO2/Game Folder Files` directory into your game folder.

#### Getting an ENB

This list uses **OBSIDIAN WEATHERS, CATHEDRAL WEATHERS OR VIVID WEATHERS DEPENDING ON THE PROFILE YOU'RE USING** so you want to get an ENB that is compatible. Here is a list of ENBs that I can recommend

Obsidian Weathers:

- [Skyrim Re-Engaged](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1089)
- [Rudy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4796)
- [Amon ENB Reborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35141)
- [Ominous](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27333)
- [Nyclix's ENB/ReShade](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3352)

Vivid Weathers:

- [Ruvaak Dahmaan](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6009)
- [Skyrim Re-Engaged](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1089)

Cathedral Weathers:

- [Semirealis](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25163)
- [Rudy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39113)
- [Skyrim Re-Engaged](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1089)
- [Ljoss](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30971)
- [ENBCo A comprehensive comparison](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35328/)

Once you found a preset you like. Download it and extract the enbseries folder, enbseries.ini and enblocal.ini to your Skyrim Special Edition directory. 

**Note : Please check that vsync is set to disable in enblocal.ini otherwise you will be stuck compiling shaders**


## How to start up Among Sovngarde's Stars

Head over to the installation folder and locate an executable named `ModOrganizer.exe` and launch it. Once its launched there will be a dropdown box on the top right and a big run button next to it. Ensure it is set to SKSE by selecting it in the dropdown box and then hitting the run button.


## Updating

If this Modlist receives an update please check the Changelog before doing anything. Always backup your saves or start a new game after updating.

**Wabbajack will delete all files that are not part of the Modlist when updating!**

This means that any additional mods you have installed on top of the Modlist will be deleted. Your downloads folder will not be touched!

Updating is like installing. You only have to make sure that you select the same path and tick the _overwrite existing Modlist_ button.

## Switching Weather Mods

Look at the drop menu on top of the right panel and next to "Profile" in MO2, you should be able to select the profile with the weather mod of your choice. Like [this](http://prntscr.com/tmu8ar).

## In-Game MCM Options
Once the game has loaded. Wait until there are no more messages on the top left corner. Then you can hit escape and click on Mod Configuration to continue this section.

## FAQ

### Ultrawide Options
If you have an ultrawide monitor (21:9 or 32:9), the UI will be off. You just need to enable "Dear Diary for (screen resolution)" under the Separator "Activate this if you have a widescreen monitor" in MO2. [Those](https://prnt.sc/udw0qv)

### Tweaking the Game Settings

I highly recommend using [BethINI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4875) which is included in this Modlist (can be found in `MO2/tools/BethINI`). I recommend tweaking the `Detail` section for more FPS:

- `Shadow Resolution`: Very big one. A good balance is `2048` which is the borderline between high FPS drainage and garbage looking shadows.
- `Ambient Occlusion`: Highly recommended to turn either this or your ENB version off. Do not have the game AO and an ENB AO turned on at the same time.
- `Remove Shadows`: If you really struggle, use this. This will disable all Shadows (not recommended)

If you have less than 6GB of VRAM, there is an alternative DynDOLOD and TexGEN output, without 3D tree lods, available in the discord. Follow the instructions to swap to the alternate.

## Removing the Modlist

You can just remove the MO2 folder and be done with it. SKSE and ENB files will still be in your game folder so I recommend using [ENB and ReShade Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4143) if you want to remove the ENB.

## How do I use High Poly Head?????
Under face part in Racemenu.

## My character is blocked in the air when trying to dodge!

Simply press G (or your swap dodge key) two times to reset it.

## I'm using a gamepad, please help me!
Go to the Discord, we have a gamepad guide for you.

## My Mega.nz download dont work! / I can't download more from mega.nz!
Go to the Discord, in the channel #Links and there will be mirrors for the files.
